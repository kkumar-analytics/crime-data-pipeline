      "The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called **Rayleigh scattering**. Here's a breakdown of how it works:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Sunlight Enters the Atmosphere:** Sunlight is actually made up of all the colors of the rainbow.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Scattering by Air Molecules:** As sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it collides with tiny air molecules (mostly nitrogen and oxygen). These molecules absorb and then re-emit the light in different directions. This process is called scattering.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Rayleigh Scattering and Wavelength:**  Rayleigh scattering is more effective at shorter wavelengths of light. Blue and violet light have shorter wavelengths than other colors like red, orange, and yellow.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Blue Light Scattered More:** Because blue and violet light have shorter wavelengths, they are scattered *much* more strongly than the other colors. This means that the blue light is scattered all over the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Why Not Violet?** Violet light is scattered even more than blue light, but the sun emits less violet light than blue light, and our eyes are also less sensitive to violet. The combination of these factors makes the sky appear blue rather than violet.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In summary:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Sunlight hits the atmosphere.\n",
      "*   Air molecules scatter the light.\n",
      "*   Blue light is scattered much more than other colors because it has a shorter wavelength.\n",
      "*   We see the scattered blue light, making the sky appear blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Think of it like this:** Imagine throwing a small ball (blue light) and a large ball (red light) at a bunch of small obstacles. The small ball is much more likely to bounce off in different directions, while the large ball is more likely to go straight through.\n",
